Hi :-)

I'm a science communicator and data scientist with a sound understanding of 
Python and packages such as Pandas, Matplotlib and Plotly.

I write weekly at [CiÃªncia Programada](https://cienciaprogramada.com.br/){: .btn
.btn--success}, a science communication project I've launched in Brazilian
Portuguese.

Currently working in the education industry solving educational problems with 
programming. I've also worked with laboratory management, as an environmental 
analyst and with scientific research.

Have a look at [my portfolio](portfolio.md){: .btn .btn--info} for more details
about my projects.
